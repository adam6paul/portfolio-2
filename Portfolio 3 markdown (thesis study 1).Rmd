> The purpose of this portfolio is to practice with data I already have and prepare for writing a path analysis, so that when I get my data I can run the analyses right away. With that in mind, this markdown has details and information for my own learning, so I can refer to it as I am writing the final version. Which, for some reason, is an earlier portfolio project. Go past me.

## Set-up

The main packages I need are lavaan and lmertest, but semPlot is used to create a visual model.

> Getting semPlot to work was a genuine ordeal, but it should all work now.


library('psych')
library('reshape2')
library('plyr')
library('lavaan')
library('Rcpp')
library('lme4')
library('lmerTest')
library('OpenMx')
library('semPlot')
rm(list=ls())

##### Bringing in the data


>Will pull the data tomorrow to practice this

```{r bringing in data}

View(Classroom_Experiences)
```

##### Data cleaning!

## Data cleaning

Will need to create composite variable for prompted disclosure out of two items.

> Old data only had one question, so that is not done below. Will add this after finishing the path analysis code

### Descriptives cleaning

##### Race dummy coding

##### Gender dummy coding

### Variables of Interest

##### Institutional belonging (belong_instit_comp4)


##### Class belonging (belong_class_comp4)


##### Class disclosure (cdiscl_disclose_comp3)


##### Class prompted disclosure (cdiscl__prompt_comp2)


#### Group disclosure (gdiscl_disclose_comp3)


##### Group prompted disclosure (gdiscl_prompt_comp2)



If I decide it's necessary, I will rename variables to make the models easy to think about here.

# MEDIATION MODELS

------------------

> This section is information given to me by Shannon, kept here and in other path analysis portfolios so I have access to them.

Reminder: Rules of thumb to evaluate goodness of fit: CFI/TLI > 0.95, RMSEA < 0.05, SRMR < 0.06  (Reference: Hu & Bentler, 1999)

# Current settings 

------------------

### Resampling 
 Right now, bootstraps are set at 1000 resamples. This to make running the script not take impossibly long
 When running final models, 10000 resamples would probably be preferred - but it'll take a while. 

### Type of CIs
 lavaan can handle four types of bootstrapped CIs; add "boot.ci.type = " to parameterEstimates
 options for types are "norm", "basic", "perc" (percentile), and "bca.simple" 
 defualt is "perc" (I think )

### Significance Levels
 alpha level for bootstrapping can be adjusted; add "level = " to parameterEstimates 
 options for levels are e.g., "95", "99"

## Model time!

------------------

##### Hypotheses

H1: Students who disclose in a class or small group will report higher feelings of belonging in the class and at their institution.

H2: Prompting disclosure in class or in small groups will be associated with greater disclosure and greater sense of belonging at the classroom and institutional level, as well as whether the relationship between disclosure and institutional belonging is mediated by classroom belonging.

>These are the covariates I am including in the model:
Gender, with female as the reference class: 
        gender_identity_dich 
Race, with white as the reference class: 
        race_asian race_black race_hispanic race_multiracial 
Classmates and group members known prior:
        classmates_know groupdesc_know_prior

#### Creating the model!

```{r Model creation}

```

```{r old model creation}
model_1 <-   '  #Class Belonging direct effects
                belong_class_comp4 ~ a*cdiscl_disclose + gender_identity_dich + race_asian 
                + race_black + race_hispanic + race_multiracial + classmates_know +                          groupdesc_know_prior
                
                belong_class_comp4 ~ b*gdiscl_disclose
                
                #WFU Belonging direct effects
                belong_wfu_comp4 ~ c*cdiscl_disclose + gender_identity_dich + race_asian 
                + race_black + race_hispanic + race_multiracial + classmates_know +                          groupdesc_know_prior
                
                belong_wfu_comp4 ~ d*gdiscl_disclose
                
                #Mediator for class disclosure
                cdiscl_disclose ~ e*cdiscl_prompt_discl
                belong_class_comp4 ~ cdiscl_prompt_discl
                belong_wfu_comp4 ~ cdiscl_prompt_discl
                
                #Mediator for group disclosure
                gdiscl_disclose ~ f*gdiscl_do_emot
                belong_class_comp4 ~ gdiscl_do_emot
                belong_wfu_comp4 ~ gdiscl_do_emot
                
                #removing correlation between prompted disclosures
                cdiscl_prompt_discl ~~ 0*gdiscl_do_emot 
                '
```

#### Testing the fit


```{r testing fit}
fit <- sem(model_1, data=Classroom_Experiences)

summary(fit, fit.measures=TRUE, standardize=TRUE, rsquare=TRUE)
```

#### Graphing!

> Will need to import graph from whichever markdown gets it right. 

```{r Path visualization}
semPaths(fit, whatLabels="par", layout="tree", nCharNodes=0, sizeMan=12, sizeMan2=6)
```

#### Bootstrapping

#####for boot strapped 95% CIs

```{r bootstrapped code}
fit <- sem(model_1, data=Classroom_Experiences, se="bootstrap", bootstrap = 10000)
summary(fit, fit.measures=TRUE, standardize=TRUE, rsquare=TRUE)
```
